              <p>
                 My name is John Harrell and I am currently a senior computer science major at <a href="https://www.tamu.edu/">Texas A&M University</a>, expecting to graduate in 
                 Fall 2023. I am 22 years old and I was born and raised in Dallas, TX. Some of my hobbies include reading (history, philosophy), sports (football, basketball, Formula 1, soccer),
                 video games, and language learning (Japanese). After I finish college, I aim to become a software developer because I really enjoy
                 being able to make something that I can call my own!
