                <p class="project-description">
                  While working as an Information Technology Intern at Texas Instruments this summer, I helped to build an application in order to help catch products
                  during the production cycle so that they did not reach customers in a defective state. Specifically, I was involved in providing the users with a 
                  new search option that allows for a greater ability to locate and contain these defective products, for previously the only functionality available
                  was a more general search that would likely result in overkill; that is, the prior searches would indicate to contain some functional products along
                  with the defective ones. The functionality I was tasked with implementing solved this issue and ensured that fewer functional products were being
                  erroneously contained. In developing this application, I was able to learn about the concepts of the front end and back end of a web application; I
                  also learned how to use the module React in order to develop the front end, as well as Spring Framework in order to develop the API for the back end.

                <p class="project-description">
                  While taking the course CSCE 441 (Computer Graphics) in the spring of 2022, I constructed a ray tracing application using C++. This application would
                  show 8 different scenes showing different shapes and showcasing various aspects of ray tracing, such as generating shadows and simulating reflections.
                  The application included both simple objects, that is those that can be directly calculated by the application using an equation, and complex objects
                  as well, meaning objects that contain an assortment of polygons that are too complex to construct mathematically but must be imported as an object
                  file. Constructing this application helped teach me about not only about ray tracing but showcased a different way of approaching computer graphics;
                  whereas rasterization, another popular method of computer graphics, focuses on approximating a 3D world with layered 2D planes, ray tracing focuses
                  on producing an image through collisions directly in a 3D world.
